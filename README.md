# chatbot-ai

chatbot-ai is an AI chatbot assistant which can assist on various topics of your choice. Unlike traditional LLM based chatbots which only generate text, chatbot-ai uses a speech feature allowing the application to speak to the user just like a human does. This makes chatbot-ai more interactive and unique. The user interface of the software is simple and easy to use, making chatbot-ai a simple and interactive website. 

The chatbot-ai software is powered by the google-Gemini large language model. We do not own any content generated by the software.
